# Maze Solver

In this project I created a program to find the shortest possible path to solve a randomly generated maze. To store the data generated I 
implemented a Queue and Stack data structure. Both are power by my 
[LinearList](https://github.com/JTinglof/beginner-java/tree/master/array-linear-list) data structre. 

## Usage

In the command line navigate to the directory and compile using javac command. To run the program type:

> java MazeSolver

The maze is hard coded to be size 35.
