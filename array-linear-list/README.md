# Array Linear List

In this project I implemented a Linear List data structure using abstract data types or ADT.

## Getting Started

you will find the code for this program in the data strcures folder. The Grader, Tester and Driver program are available to 
show the functionality of the program. 

## Usage

In the command line type:

> javac ArrayLinearList.java

Then complie your driver:

> javac [DriverName].java

Then run your driver via:

java [DriverName].java

## Acknowledgments

* Hat tip to Alan Riggins for the tester programs.

## Usage

In the command line type:

> python prog4_[version number] [yourfile].txt
